Sole Programmer, Designer, Writer, and Artist

Circus Lyfe is a narrative life simulation game for Android devices, created for my senior undergraduate thesis at New College of Florida.

The player takes the role of a circus’ new trapeze artist and experiences both the social and professional sides of their new life. As the game progresses, the player will hone their skills on the trapeze and forge a friendship with another trapeze artist, Donna. This leads to the player’s debut performance in the circus, where they will be tested on their trapeze abilities and have the opportunity to perform alongside Donna if they have become good friends.

Circus Lyfe was written in Unity 2019.3.3f1, using a modified version of Yarn Spinner version 1.1. I wrote the game's story and dialogue, created art assets, designed, and implemented the game over the course of the Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 semesters.

Lead Programmer

In a fantasy realm ruled by a sinister Dark Lord, some people are just trying to get by. Players step into the role of a standard RPG shopkeeper who must tread the fine line of freedom vs profit as they sell their goods to both the chosen hero and their evil ruler. Stock the shop, set the prices, and choose carefully who you sell what to. Selling to the Dark Lord may decrease the hero's chances, but the hero may not have enough gold to keep you in buisness. 

My primary responsibilities consisted of implementing the primary gameplay loop, customer AI, the quest system and progression. The game was implemented in Unity for WebGl over the course of 48 hours.
