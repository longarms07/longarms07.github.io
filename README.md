Circus Lyfe is a narrative life simulation game for Android devices, created for my senior undergraduate thesis at New College of Florida.

This is a life simulation game for the mobile platform, where the player takes the role of a circus’ new trapeze artist and experiences both the social and professional sides of their new life. As the game progresses, the player will hone their skills on the trapeze and forge a friendship with another trapeze artist, Donna. This leads to the player’s debut performance in the circus, where they will be tested on their trapeze abilities and have the opportunity to perform alongside Donna if they have become good friends.

Circus Lyfe was written in Unity 2019.3.3f1, using a modified version of Yarn Spinner version 1.1. I wrote the game's story and dialogue, created art assets, designed, and implemented the game over the course of a year.
