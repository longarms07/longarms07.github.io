Sole Programmer, Designer, Writer, and Artist

Circus Lyfe is a narrative life simulation game for Android devices, created for my senior undergraduate thesis at New College of Florida.

The player takes the role of a circus’ new trapeze artist and experiences both the social and professional sides of their new life. As the game progresses, the player will hone their skills on the trapeze and forge a friendship with another trapeze artist, Donna. This leads to the player’s debut performance in the circus, where they will be tested on their trapeze abilities and have the opportunity to perform alongside Donna if they have become good friends.

Circus Lyfe was written in Unity 2019.3.3f1, using a modified version of Yarn Spinner version 1.1. I wrote the game's story and dialogue, created art assets, designed, and implemented the game over the course of the Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 semesters.

Lead Programmer

In a fantasy realm ruled by a sinister Dark Lord, some people are just trying to get by. Players step into the role of a standard RPG shopkeeper who must tread the fine line of freedom vs profit as they sell their goods to both the chosen hero and their evil ruler. Stock the shop, set the prices, and choose carefully who you sell what to. Selling to the Dark Lord may decrease the hero's chances, but the hero may not have enough gold to keep you in buisness. 

My primary responsibilities consisted of implementing the primary gameplay loop, customer AI, the quest system and progression. The game was implemented in Unity for WebGl over the course of 48 hours.

Stranded on a desolate planet as armies of ships fight above you, the only option is to improvise. Dodge missiles, trick enemy ships into destroying each other, and use their wreckage to build your own spaceship and fight back.

This game was created in Unity for WebGL over the course of 48 hours. I implemented the shipbuilding and movement controls, and lead the game's design.

Co-Programmer, Room and Puzzle Design

Waking up in an an flower shop with little memory, you must discover why you are there. Explore the shop, solve puzzles to unlock more rooms, and discover why your character keeps blacking out. 

_Forget Me Not_ was implemented in Unity and is playable on Windows Machines. It was built in a team of 6 (3 programmers, 2 artists, and a composer) over 48 for the Ringling College of Art and Design's Spring 2019 game jam. My primary responsibilities were the room switch implementation and putting together the main room and greenhouse.

August-September 2015

Based on _The Adventure of the Crooked Man_ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, play as the legendary Sherlock Holmes as he investigates the strange murder of Colonel James Barclay. Question witnesses, find evidence, and discover the truth of what happened. 

I programmed and created all art assets for the game in [OHRRPGCE](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page), and adapted the dialogue and scenario. This was my first game, created as a project for my high school digital arts class at Dreyfoos School of the Arts.

### Staying Healthy Quiz

Primary Developer, Remote Contractor for the Florida Literacy Coalition

Do you know how long you should you brush your teeth? Or how your body responds to stress? Test your health knowledge by taking one of these fun and educational quizzes. Based on the popular Staying Healthy curriculum series, choose from three quiz levels: Easy, Hard or Random, a mix of questions from both levels. The questions change, so take it again and again. Challenge yourself to beat your best score!

Initial work on the app began in the Mobile App Development class at New College of Florida, where we worked in teams to create proof-of-concept prototypes for the FLC. I was chosen to continue development and publish the commercial version of the application.

For this project, I implemented the in-app SQLite question databases as well as the Firebase account and online score database systems. I designed the UX, put together the quiz flow, and added the ability to read reference material and toggle the Spanish versions of quiz questions. Time management and requirement gathering were also my resonsibilities.

April 2019 - May 2019

Co-Programmer and Designer

Test your knowledge on the sealife in the Sarasota International Airport! By scanning certain pictures and statues, users can unlock quizes to learn more about the animals there. Completing these quizzes unlocks sea animal puppets you can play around with in Augmented Reality.

Android Studio and ARCore were used to implement this application. This was a group term project for the Intro to AR class at New College of Florida. My primary responsibilities consisted of designing and implementing the quiz and photo detection, as well as collaborating on the general app architecture.

June 2020 - January 2021

Programmer, Graduate Research Assistant

Childhood development assessment is a field with high demand, but there is a shortage of tools to assist therapists making access hard to come by. Foxworld is a CSU research project aiming to test the effectiveness of virtual embodied avatars in childhood development assessment tools. Ideally, the tools that result from this research will help make assessment more accessible and help therapists perform it. This project is funded by DARPA, and research is ongoing.

As a Graduate Research Assistant at CSU, I lead the development of this project as the sole programmer during 2020. The project was developed in Untiy and built for WebGL. For early webcam gesture recognition prototypes, I worked with OpenCV and ML-based pose recognition frameworks like EpipolarPose. I also designed and implemented several tasks within the program, such as the "Gesture Elicitation" section that will help researchers learn what mid-air gestures children naturally perform to manipulate 3D objects. 

To learn more about this project and its current status, please contact the [CSU NUILab](https://nuilab.org/).
